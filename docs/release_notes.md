This is the `v0.2.1` release of the `typinox` project.

In this version:

- Documents are now available in the `docs` directory
  and are available on [Read the Docs](https://typinox.readthedocs.io).
- Several minor improvements.
- The CI pipeline has been improved. A `pre-commit` hook is now used to check for
  formatting and linting issues.

<!-- TODO before release: pyproject.toml, docs/src/conf.py -->
